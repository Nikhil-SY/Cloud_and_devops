#Docker Fundamentals:

Container: Container is a isolated environment to run any code or application
Images: Images are used to run containers

You can build an image using the following docker build command via a CLI in your project folder.
docker build -t welcome-to-docker .
Breaking down this command

The -t flag tags your image with a name. (welcome-to-docker in this case). And the . lets Docker know where it can find the Dockerfile.

Run your container
Once the build is complete, an image will appear in the Images tab. Select the image name to see its details. Select Run to run it as a container. In the Optional settings remember to specify a port number (something like 8089).

 here's a simplified explanation of a typical Docker workflow:

Developing an Application:

You start by developing your application using your preferred programming language and frameworks. This application could be anything from a web server to a microservice or a database.
Writing Dockerfile:

Next, you create a Dockerfile. This file defines the steps needed to create a Docker image for your application. It specifies the base image, copies your application code into the image, installs dependencies, and configures the environment.
Building Docker Image:

Using the Dockerfile, you build a Docker image. This process involves running the docker build command, which reads the Dockerfile, executes the instructions, and creates a ready-to-run Docker image that contains your application and its dependencies.
Running Docker Container:

Once the Docker image is built, you can run it as a Docker container using the docker run command. A Docker container is an instance of a Docker image that runs as a lightweight, isolated process on the host machine. Running a container starts your application and any services it requires.
Testing and Iteration:

With your application running in a Docker container, you can test its functionality to ensure everything works as expected. If changes are needed, you can modify your application code and repeat the Docker image build and container run steps.
Deploying Docker Containers:

When you're satisfied with your application and want to deploy it, you can push your Docker image to a Docker registry (like Docker Hub, AWS ECR, or a private registry). This allows others or different environments (like production servers) to pull and run your Docker image.
Scaling and Managing Containers:

Docker enables you to easily scale your application by running multiple instances of your Docker containers across different hosts or on a single host using orchestration tools like Docker Compose (for development) or Kubernetes (for production).
Monitoring and Maintenance:

Docker provides tools and integrations for monitoring the performance of your Docker containers and managing their lifecycle. You can monitor resource usage, logs, and health status, and perform maintenance tasks like updating containers with new versions of your application.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

Docker is often integrated into CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. CI/CD tools can automatically build Docker images, run tests inside containers, and deploy updated images to production environments.
Overall, Docker simplifies the process of packaging, distributing, and running applications by providing a consistent environment across different platforms and making it easier to manage dependencies and configurations.





#This is to deploy react application

Deploying your React.js application to AWS using Docker involves several steps. Below, I'll guide you through deploying the application using Amazon Elastic Beanstalk, which simplifies the process of deploying and managing applications in the AWS cloud.

Step-by-Step Guide:
1. Set Up Your AWS Account:
If you don't have an AWS account, sign up at AWS.
2. Install the AWS CLI:
Download and install the AWS CLI from here.
Configure the AWS CLI with your credentials:

Prepare Your React Application:
Ensure your React.js project has a Dockerfile in the root directory. Here is an example Dockerfile:

# Use the official Node.js image.
FROM node:14

# Create and change to the app directory.
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy application dependency manifests to the container image.
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies.
RUN npm install

# Copy local code to the container image.
COPY . .

# Build the React application
RUN npm run build

# Install serve to serve the build files
RUN npm install -g serve

# Run the app
CMD ["serve", "-s", "build"]

EXPOSE 5000

Putting It All Together
When you build and run this Docker container, the following happens:

Docker pulls the Node.js version 14 image.
The working directory inside the container is set to /usr/src/app.
The dependency files (package.json and package-lock.json) are copied to the container.
Dependencies are installed using npm install.
The entire application code is copied to the container.
The React application is built, producing static files in the build directory.
serve is installed globally to serve the built files.
The container is set to run serve in SPA mode to serve the files in the build directory.
Port 5000 is exposed, indicating that the application will be accessible via this port inside the container.
You can then run this container, and it will serve your React.js application, making it accessible on port 5000.

Install Elastic Beanstalk CLI:
Install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI (EB CLI) following the instructions here.

Initialize Elastic Beanstalk Application:
In your project directory, initialize an Elastic Beanstalk application:

eb init

Follow the prompts to select your region, application name, and other settings. Choose Docker as the platform.

Create an Environment:
Create an environment and deploy your application:

Deploy Your Application:
To deploy your application, run

eb deploy


Access Your Application:
Once the deployment is complete, you can access your application using the URL provided by Elastic Beanstalk. You can get this URL by running:

eb open


Additional Details:
Configuring Domain Name (Optional):
If you have a custom domain, you can point it to your Elastic Beanstalk environment by configuring a CNAME record in your DNS settings. The CNAME should point to the URL provided by Elastic Beanstalk.
Updating the Application:
To update your application, make your changes, commit them to your Git repository, and run:
eb deploy


Monitoring and Managing the Environment:
You can use the Elastic Beanstalk web console to monitor and manage your environment. The console provides tools for viewing logs, managing environment settings, and scaling your application.
By following these steps, you can deploy your React.js application using Docker on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, making it accessible on the internet. This approach leverages the power of AWS to manage the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to focus on developing your application.


Multi stage docker builds

Multi-stage Docker builds are a feature in Docker that allow you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile, effectively creating different stages in the build process. This approach helps in optimizing Docker images by allowing you to:

Separate the Build Environment from the Runtime Environment:

The first stages (or stages early in the Dockerfile) are typically used for compiling, building, or setting up the application. These stages might require a full development environment with all the necessary tools and libraries.
The final stage is usually a minimal environment where the application runs. This stage only contains what is needed to execute the application, such as the compiled binaries or built assets.
Reduce Image Size:

By copying only the necessary artifacts from the build stages into the final image, you avoid including unnecessary dependencies and tools. This results in a smaller, more efficient Docker image.
Improve Security:

Minimizing the final image reduces the attack surface by excluding unnecessary tools, libraries, and other files that could be exploited.
Example of a Multi-Stage Build Process
Consider a React application as an example:

Build Stage:

You use a Node.js image to install dependencies and build the application. This stage includes all the necessary tools like npm or yarn, compilers, etc.
Runtime Stage:

After building the application, you use a minimal Nginx image to serve the built static files. This stage does not need Node.js, compilers, or any of the build tools, so they are not included in the final image.
Here's a simplified breakdown of what happens in each stage:

Stage 1: Build Environment

Install dependencies.
Compile and build the application.
Produce build artifacts (e.g., static files for a web app, binaries for a compiled application).

Stage 2: Runtime Environment

Set up a minimal base image suitable for running the application (e.g., an Alpine Linux image with Nginx).
Copy the build artifacts from the previous stage into the runtime environment.
Configure the runtime environment to serve the application (e.g., configuring Nginx to serve the static files).
By isolating the build and runtime environments, you ensure that the final Docker image is lean, efficient, and only contains the essentials for running the application.

Using multi-stage Docker builds can help optimize the size of your Docker images by separating the build and runtime environments. Here's an example Dockerfile for a React application using multi-stage builds:

# Stage 1: Build the React app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Build the React app
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve the app with a lightweight server
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the build output from the previous stage to the Nginx web server
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom Nginx configuration file, if needed (optional)
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
Explanation:
Stage 1: Build Stage

FROM node:18 AS build: Uses a Node.js image to build the React application. The AS build part names this stage "build."
WORKDIR /app: Sets the working directory in the container to /app.
COPY package*.json ./: Copies package.json and package-lock.json to the container.
RUN npm install: Installs dependencies.
COPY . .: Copies the rest of the application source code to the container.
RUN npm run build: Builds the React application. The output will be in the build directory.
Stage 2: Serve Stage

FROM nginx:alpine: Uses a lightweight Nginx image to serve the static files.
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html: Copies the build output from the first stage to the Nginx server's default directory.
EXPOSE 80: Exposes port 80, which Nginx uses.
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]: Starts the Nginx server in the foreground.
Optional: Custom Nginx Configuration
If you have specific requirements for your Nginx server configuration, you can add a custom nginx.conf file by uncommenting and adjusting the relevant line in the Dockerfile.
