Master-Slave Architecture in Jenkins
Master: The Jenkins master is the main server instance. It manages jobs, builds, and distributes them to agents (slaves). The master schedules builds, monitors agents, and coordinates the overall workload.

Slave (Agent): A Jenkins slave, or agent, is a worker machine that executes the jobs dispatched by the master. Agents can be configured on different operating systems and environments to accommodate diverse build requirements.

Jenkins Master: The central server responsible for:

Scheduling jobs.
Monitoring agents.
Distributing build requests.
Jenkins Slaves (Agents): These are the worker nodes that:

Receive build jobs from the master.
Execute the jobs in their respective environments.
Report back to the master with build results.
How it works:
Job Execution: When a job is triggered, the Jenkins master selects an available agent based on predefined criteria (like label expressions or capabilities).

Distributed Builds: Jobs can be distributed across multiple agents, allowing parallel execution and efficient resource utilization.

Configuration: Agents are configured with specific tools and environments necessary for job execution, such as different operating systems, software versions, or hardware configurations.

Scalability and Flexibility: This architecture allows Jenkins to scale horizontally by adding more agents to handle increased workload or diverse build requirements.

Benefits:
Resource Utilization: Efficiently distributes workload across multiple machines, optimizing resource usage.

Parallel Execution: Enables concurrent execution of jobs, reducing overall build time.

Flexibility: Supports different operating systems and environments for diverse build requirements.

Fault Tolerance: If one agent fails, jobs can be rerouted to other available agents, ensuring continuous build operations.

In summary, the master-slave architecture in Jenkins enhances scalability, flexibility, and efficiency in managing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines by distributing workload across multiple nodes.
